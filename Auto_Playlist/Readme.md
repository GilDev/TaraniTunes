There is already a 3rd party program to make autoplaylist and it is works perfectly 
Credit has to go to @ridgerunner for mentoining it in his post on RCGroups.com

Here is the post ["Ridgerunr" discusses Taranis Jukebox](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=31361271&postcount=41772)

It took awhile to get the syntax exactly right for use in TarniTunes.

English Instructions
--------------------

1. Copy the .wav files you want to make into a playlist to a new folder.    
    The program works with directories.  It will load the entire directory if you try and load your files already in /sounds.     
If you haven't converted the files yet using [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org), now would be a good time.  They must be converted to mono, preferably normalized, and encoded in Microsoft WAV 16-bits signed PCM at a 32 kHz sampling rate.
2. Download the program [MpTag](http://www.mp3tag.de/en/)(consider making a donation)
3. Install the program
4. Run the program

### Using the Program
------------
1. Under `File` Choose 
![`Add Directory`](Screenshot2/directory.png)
